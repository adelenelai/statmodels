# statmodels

Functions I developed as part of my MSc. thesis 'Modelling Pesticide Biodegradation Using Regulatory Data'. Dataset is from the EAWAG-Soil package of envipath, see https://envipath.org/wiki/index.php/EAWAG-SOIL_package

## crossvalidation
Functions for internal cross-validation (10-fold and Leave-One-Out) of lm model objects. Output R2, adjR2 (where possible), RMSE, and MAE.

## myplsr
Running partial least squares regression using {pls} by Bjorn Mevik. Functions to group together some modelling steps for quicker pls regression model fitting.
